# CRUDAppInnoCV
Daniel Clemente Assessment

This is the CRUD App that I have done. I have implemented all the CRUD operations and
I have added an orderBy feature to order the different objects created by the user.

I know tests left but I understand that they are optional and I don't have a lot
of practice with them. It is one of the reasons I want to change my job, to learn more things like this.

I hope you like this little project and I want to keep learning to improve my code because I know
that it is not the cleanest code :)
